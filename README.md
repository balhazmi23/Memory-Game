# Concentration Game

This is Project 2 Implementation of Udacity Front End Nandodegree program. It resembles a concentration game, where you have to focus and concentrate on which boxes have been open, and which have not yet been opened. The goal of the game is to match the flipped cards in as fewer moves as possible. The highest score is obtained when no mistak is made.

# Matching Cards Game

The game starts when you make the first choice move. So the timer begins to record your done time for all the pairs of the table. There are plenty of moves you can take and no limit in game time but you take three stars for the game completion only if you make it with minimum moves.

There are Font awesome's symbols anchor, diamond, leaf, bomb, bolt, bicycle, paper-plane, cube, used to design the cards.
 Memory Game Project

A [Udacity](www.udacity.com) project developed using HTMl, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

## How To Play:

This is a memory matching card game. The goal is to match each card's icon with its pair. There are 16 cards and 8 pairs total. Click on a card, remember its icon and spot in the grid, then continue clicking other cards until you find its match. The game ends once all pairs are matched.

Keep track of progress in the score panel area by viewing the star raiting, how many moves have been made, and how long it takes to finish the game.

## Used Libraries

Also used [Font Awesom](https://fontawesome.com) to get access to icons for the cards. The library includes webfonts, so I had to add a folder to accommodate that as well.

## Game Behavior

 Memory Game Logic     | The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched. |
| Congratulations Popup | When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was. |
| Restart Button        | A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating. |
| Star Rating           | The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a 1 star rating. |
| Timer                 | When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops. |
| Move Counter          | Game displays the current number of moves a user has made. |

- All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers. It is tested and running well at the latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari browser .

## Documentation

- A README file is included detailing the game and all dependencies.
- Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.
